CmRDT:
    ☐ In `LWWRegister`, rename `update` to `set` (easier to understand)
    ☐ In `LWWRegister`, rename `query` to `read` (easier to understand)
    ☐ In `LWWRegister`, update with a contructor to force timestamp initialization (and remove `U _timestamp = {0}`)
    ☐ In `LWWMap`, change the value to be CRDT by default (using `LWWRegister`)
    ☐ In `LWWMap`, rename the `add` to `set` or `insert` and also take a value
    ☐ In `LWWGraph`, change the value to be CRDT by default (using `LWWRegister`)
Collabdata:
    ☐ Update all pointers with safer type (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`)
    ☐ Create a end user API (e.g., `CollabGraph`, `CollabRegister`) that doesn't require CRDT knowledges
Readme:
    ☐ Update README content
    ☐ Update README with a custom logo
